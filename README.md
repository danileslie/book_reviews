#### Description:

This was made as my CS50 final project, a book review site.

You are able to register, login, and logout from the application.

In the application, you are free to search up books, add them to your booklist, and add a review. Once complete, the review is visible on the review page.
The review can be deleted from the account, without deleting the book.

If the book entry is deleted from the account, any reviews associated with the review is also deleted from the account.

The app.py page contains all of the major functions, tied to logging in, logging out, registering a book, deleting a review, etc.

The information is stored in a database, reviews.db, which records the registered users, their booklist, and their reviews.
